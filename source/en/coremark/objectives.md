# Test Objectives

Evaluate power consumption under different computational intensities using standardized processor tests:

- **CoreMark Benchmark**: Industry-standard CPU performance benchmark.
- **While Loop Test**: Baseline power measurement for simple loop operations.
- **Shutdown Mode Test**: Measure minimum power in the lowest-power state.
